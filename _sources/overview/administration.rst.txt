The PyAnsys project allows you to create your own workflows and 
interfaces to Ansys products using Ansys APIs. While using PyAnsys 
libraries requires that the relevant Ansys products are licensed 
either directly or indirectly, you can distribute your custom-made 
applications and workflows internally or externally.


Licensing and approval
======================
To allow for commercial use, a PyAnsys library must use the MIT
license. Because this license falls in the BSD-style license class,
PyAnsys libraries can be used as a shared library with no
restrictions. This follows the pattern of including PyAnsys as a
dependency in ``install_requires`` in the ``setup.py`` file.

Should you choose to copy and include any PyAnsys project source uses,
to make your library suitable for commercial use, you need only a copy
of the original PyAnsys MIT license in the reused code.

To view this license, see the :ref:`The \`\`LICENSE\`\` file` file in the root
directory of this repository. This file must be included in the root directory
of the repository of every PyAnsys library.

Project approval
================
Exposing new Ansys technologies through the PyAnsys project is subject
to an internal review and decision process. For requests, email the PyAnsys Core
team at `Stephane Marguerin <mailto:stephane.marguerin@ansys.com>`_
or `Alexander Kaszynski <mailto:alexander.kaszynski@ansys.com>`_.

Repository management and standards
===================================
Each PyAnsys repository should at the minimum be administrated by a
single individual with "Admin" permissions over the repository. This
enables them to override any blocking pull requests or to change the
settings for that repository, such as GitHub pages, repository
description, or branch protection management.

Each repository is expected to follow this minimum set of standards:

- PEP8 code standards. See :ref:`PEP 8`.
- CI/CD using GitHub actions or Azure DevOps to enforce coding standards.
- Publicly hosted documentation describing the API and providing examples. See
  :ref:`Documentation style`.
- Unit testing with at least 80% test coverage.
- Infrastructure in place to deploy the library as a package on `PyPI
  <https://pypi.org/>`_.  See :ref:`Packaging style`.
- Proper license file and author. See :ref:`The \`\`setup.py\`\` file` and :ref:`The \`\`LICENSE\`\` file`.
- :ref:`Semantic versioning` for :ref:`Releasing and publishing`.
