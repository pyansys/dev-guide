Releasing and publishing
========================
Releasing a new version is a critical procedure. It should be automated as much as
possible to avoid human error.

This sections explains in detail the :ref:`Git` workflow to be followed together
with the different steps that developers need to follow to create a successful
release.


Semantic versioning
-------------------
PyAnsys library releases are managed through both automated and manual review
processes.

PyAnsys follows the `Semantic Versioning`_, which produces release names in the
form of ``X.Y.Z``, where each letter corresponds to an integer value. This
notation can also be understand as ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``:

* **Major** version when you make incompatible API changes.
* **Minor** version when you add a feature in a backwards-compatible manner.
* **Patch** version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

One exception exists. ``MAJOR`` versions are not expected to be regularly released
when any incompatible API changes are made. They are only expected to be
released with major, globally breaking API changes. This matches the versioning
methodology for the "big three" data science Python libraries: `NumPy`_,
`SciPy`_, and `pandas`_.

.. _Semantic Versioning: https://semver.org/
.. _NumPy: https://numpy.org/
.. _SciPy: https://www.scipy.org/
.. _pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/

Note that ``0.MINOR.PATCH`` packages are expected to have fluid APIs and should
be solidified at the ``1.MINOR.PATCH`` release. At that point, APIs are expected
to be much more stable.

.. admonition:: PyAnsys libraries should not match product versions.

    For example, the PyMAPDL library ``ansys-mapdl-core`` might have the version
    ``0.59.0`` whereas the product version is 21.2 (2021 R2). The reason behind
    this is PyAnsys libraries are expected to be developed outside the product
    release cycle in a rapid CI/CD manner.

Branching model
---------------
The branching model for a PyAnsys project enables rapid development of
features without sacrificing stability. The model closely follows the
`Trunk Based Development <https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/>`_ approach:


- The ``main`` branch is the primary development branch. All features,
  patches, and other branches should be merged here. While all PRs
  should pass all applicable CI checks, this branch might be functionally
  unstable if changes have introduced unintended side effects or bugs
  that were not caught through unit testing. The version is always suffixed
  with ``.dev0`` in the ``main`` branch.

  .. include:: diag/main_branch.rst


- When a minor release candidate is ready, a new ``release`` branch is
  created from ``main`` with the next incremented minor version
  (for example, ``release/0.2``). This ``release`` branch is thoroughly
  tested. When deemed stable, it is tagged with the version (``0.2.0``
  in this case). Older release branches should not be deleted so that they can be
  patched as needed.


- There is one or more ``release/`` branches based on minor releases (for
  example, ``release/0.2``) that contain a stable version of the code base that
  is also reflected on PyPI. Hotfixes from ``fix/`` branches should be
  integrated both to ``main`` and to these branches. When creating a new patch
  release is necessary, these release branches have their version updated
  and are tagged with a patched :ref:`Semantic versioning` (for example,
  ``0.2.1``).  This triggers CI to push to PyPI so that hotfixes for past
  versions can be rapidly push without having to worry about untested features.

  .. include:: diag/release_branch.rst


Releasing major and minor versions
----------------------------------
When creating a new major or minor version, ensure your ``origin main`` branch is
up to date with:

.. code-block:: text

   git checkout main && git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main

If you encounter any issues when running previous command, solve those before
continuing with the release. Ensure that your style, tests, and documentation
checks are passing too.

Create a new branch for the version you want to release with:

.. code-block:: text

   git checkout -b release/X.Y

Update ``X`` or ``Y`` version numbers in your project and replace the ``dev0``
with a ``0``.

Check all locations, including
:ref:`The \`\`setup.py\`\` file`, :ref:`The \`\`pyproject.toml\`\` file`, and any
``__init__.py`` or ``__version__.py`` your project may contain.

Stash and commit previous changes with:

.. code-block:: text

   git add . && git commit -m "Bump version X.Y.0"

Tag the previous commit with:

.. code-block:: text

   git tag vX.Y.0

Push the commit and the tag with:

.. code-block:: text

   git push -u origin release/X.Y && git push origin vX.Y.0


Releasing patched versions
--------------------------
Patched versions allow you to fix issues discovered in published releases by
cherry-picking these fixes from the ``main`` branch.

To create a patched version, you must first identify which ``release/X.Y``
branch it belongs to. Then, ensure your local ``release/X.Y`` is up to date
with the origin one because other patched versions may have been introduced.

.. code-block:: text

   git checkout release/X.Y && git fetch origin release/X.Y && git rebase origin/release/X.Y

If you encounter any issues when running this command, solve them before
continuing with the release. 

Now, `cherry-pick <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick>`_ the fix commit
from ``main``, which solves for the bug. Do not merge changes from ``main`` into the
release branch. Always cherry-pick them.

.. code-block:: text
   
   git cherry-pick <commit hash>

Ensure that your style, tests, and documentation checks are also passing.

Increase by one unit the value of ``Z`` in your project version. Stash and
amend these new changes with:

.. code-block:: text

   git add . && git commit --amend -m "Bump version X.Y.Z"

Tag the previous commit with:

.. code-block:: text

   git tag vX.Y.Z

Push the commit and the tag with:

.. code-block:: text

   git push -u origin release/X.Y && git push origin vX.Y.Z


Publishing artifacts
--------------------
When a new version is released, some artifacts are provided with it. In Python,
these :ref:`Artifacts` are typically the ``Wheel`` and ``Source`` files.
Documentation in the form of PDF and HTML files are also considered artifacts.

.. admonition:: Do not distribute artifacts without approval. 

   For more information about requesting approval for publishing your project,
   see :ref:`Project approval`.

Manual release processes are discouraged and should be avoided. Automated
release processes minimize human-error and alleviate workload on teams. For more
information, see :ref: `Automating Release Process`.


Publishing privately on PyPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is sometimes necessary to host and pull packages that are not ready to be
hosted on the public `PyPI`_. For example, if a PyAnsys library requires
auto-generated gRPC' interface files from a feature or service that is still
private, this package should be hosted on a private PyPI repository.

ANSYS, Inc. has a private repository at `PyAnsys PyPI`_. Access is controlled
via a ``Personal Access Token (PAT)`` and a ``PYANSYS_PYPI_PRIVATE_PAT``
password in the form of a GitHub secret which is available only to repositories
within `PyAnsys`_.

.. admonition:: A note on secrets access in forked repositories

   Forked GitHub repositories do not have access to GitHub secrets. This is
   designed to protect against PRs that could potentially scrape tokens from
   PyAnsys CI/CD.

Upload
++++++
You can upload packages to the private repository with the following short bash
script. If you are operating out of a GitHub CI pipeline, email the PyAnsys Core
team at `pyansys.core@ansys.com <mailto:pyansys.core@ansys.com>`_ for the
required ``PAT`` user name and ``PYANSYS_PYPI_PRIVATE_PAT`` password.

Assuming that you are already in a Python repository's ``dist/`` directory that
contains your wheel, source distribution, or both, you can upload to the private
repository with:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -U pip build twine

   REPOSITORY_URL="https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/pyansys/_packaging/pyansys/pypi/upload"
   python -m twine upload dist/* \
     -p ${{ secrets.PYANSYS_PYPI_PRIVATE_PAT }} \
     -u PAT \
     --repository-url $REPOSITORY_URL

Alternatively, instead of command-line tool arguments for Twine, you can use environment variables:

.. code::

   export TWINE_USERNAME=PAT
   export TWINE_PASSWORD=$PYANSYS_PYPI_PRIVATE_PAT
   export TWINE_REPOSITORY_URL="https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/pyansys/_packaging/pyansys/pypi/upload"

   python -m twine upload dist/*


Download
++++++++
You can download a Python package from `PyAnsys PyPI`_ with:

.. code::

   INDEX_URL=https://$PYANSYS_PYPI_PRIVATE_PAT@pkgs.dev.azure.com/pyansys/_packaging/pyansys/pypi/simple/
   pip install ansys-<product/tool>-<library> --index-url $INDEX_URL --no-dependencies

.. note::
   A read-only PAT is available for users who need only to download the package. It
   can be stored as an environment variable and be used as described in the preceding code example.
   To get access to this PAT, email the PyAnsys Core team at `pyansys.core@ansys.com <pyansys.core@ansys.com>`.

.. warning::
   Take care to always use the ``--index-url`` switch rather than the
   ``--extra-index-url`` switch. As noted in `pip Documentation`_, the
   ``--index-url`` switch changes the Python Package Index, which forces ``pip``
   to use only packages from that package index.

   The Ansys package index uses PyPI upstream. This prevents other users from being able to
   inject packages from PyPI that would supersede Ansys packages, even if they
   are of a higher version.

   This is not the case if you use ``--extra-index-url``, which adds to rather
   than replaces the default package index. For security, do not use
   ``--extra-index-url``.
 
Publishing to PyPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Publishing :ref:`Artifacts` to `PyPI`_ is the way of distributing :ref:`Python
libraries`. Publishing to `PyPI`_ requires a ``PYPI_TOKEN`` for your project. To
generate and get access to this token:

- Contact `Alexander Kaszynski <mailto:alexander.kaszynski@ansys.com>`_
  requesting access to the ``PYPI_TOKEN``. The value of this token depends
  on whether you are :ref:`Initially publishing to PyPI` or :ref:`Republishing
  to PyPI`. 

- Add this token to the ``Secrets/Actions`` section in your repository.

Initially publishing to PyPI
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
If it is the first time that you are publishing your project to `PyPI`_,
you must obtain the global ``PYPI_TOKEN`` for the `PyAnsys`_ user in
`PyPI` by contacting `Alexander Kaszynski <mailto:alexander.kaszynski@ansys.com>`_.

Republishing to PyPI
++++++++++++++++++++
If you are republishing your project to `PyPI`, you no longer need to have
the global ``PYPI_TOKEN`` but rather a unique project token. To
obtain your unique project token, contact `Alexander Kaszynski
<mailto:alexander.kaszynski@ansys.com>`_ or `Maxime Rey
<mailto:maxime.rey@ansys.com>`_. Once you have received it,
update the token value in the ``Secrets/Actions`` section.

Publishing to GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Publishing :ref:`Artifacts` to GitHub is also possible. These are available
in the ``https://github.com/pyansys/project-name/releases`` section.
Publishing :ref:`Artifacts` into GitHub manually must be avoided to reduce
human-error. For more information, see :ref:`Automating the release process`.

Automating the release process
------------------------------
Automating the release process is a good practice because it minimizes human error and
alleviates the developer's workload. 

The following GitHub Actions code is triggered every time a new ``tag`` gets pushed
to your project repository. This workflow depends on the success of the style, tests,
docs, and build workflows. For more information, see :ref:`Workflow examples`.
