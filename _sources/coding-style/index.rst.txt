Coding style
############

Coding style refers to the different rules defined in a software project that
must be followed when writing source code. These rules ensure that all
the source code looks the same across different files of the
project.

Because the PyAnsys ecosystem consists of many projects, coding style rules
are critical to ensuring that the source code looks the same across different
projects.

PyAnsys libraries are expected to follow `PEP 8`_ and be consistent in style and
formatting with the 'big three' data science libraries: `NumPy`_, `SciPy`_, and
`pandas`_.
