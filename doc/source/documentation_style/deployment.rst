Documentation Deployment
------------------------

Documentation for the PyAnsys project is hosted via `GitHub Pages`_ Given the
open-source nature of the project, documentation built by each PyAnsys library
or project should be public and editable by users and the community at large.

After following the documentation build strategy contained within both the
`ansys-templates`_ and `pyansys-sphinx-theme`_ you will end up with html
documentation files in ``doc/build/html``.
